    Problem solving and Travelling, my two favourite hobbies. <br/>
    I absolutely love solving peoples problems, it's probably why I got into software
    development! <br/>
    The feeling of fixing something, helping someone or reliving someone of their pain gives
    me immense satisfaction. <br/>
    They do say, if you love your job, you've never really worked, so I can safely say, I've
    never
    really worked. <br/>
    I consider myself lucky to of found my passion early, I know many people are struggling but
    I'd say the biggest thing to help me find my passion is travel!
</p>

<p>
    You see, I'm a curious person, I want to see the world, to experience a different life
    style, a different culture. <br/>
    My cousin once told me, the biggest education in life you'll ever get is to see the world.
    <br/>
    He was definitely right! <br/>

    This brings me to Thailand, I recently moved here and it's been the best decision I've ever
    made to date. <br/>
    Thailand is an absolutely wonderful country, it has warm weather all year round, amazing food and the people,
    oh the people, they call it the land of smiles for a reason, I've never felt more welcome
    than in Thailand. <br/>
    I can definitely see myself staying here for the next few years at least, I'll get to travel
    around Asia whilst living in Thailand.
    It's nice to have a home so for me, Thailand is perfect.
